1)How can u create constants in java?
by using static final keyword,
Syntax:final keyword datatype identifier_name = constant; 
   

2)how many datatypes are there in java?
   There are two types of datatypes 
*primitive
*non-primitive

3)why Is specifing datatype mandatory in java
   Java is a strongly typed language. This means that all operations are type-checked by the compiler for type compatibility. Illegal operations will not be compiled. Thus, strong type checking helps prevent errors and enhances reliability.



4)what are  some common naming convertions for java variables?
  * All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), currency character ($) or an underscore 
   *After the first character, identifiers can have any combination of characters.
   * A keyword cannot be used as an identifier.



5)what is variable initialization how it is difference than assignment?
initialization: to initialize a variable. It can be done at the time of declaration.
 assignment: to assign value to a variable. It can be done anywhere, only once with the final-identifier.


6)what is array?
   Array is container which stores the similar type of data/elements.

7)can u pass the negative number in array size?
  NO


8)where does array stored in JVM memory?
Heap area

9)what are the advantage of array?
1) Array stores data elements of the same data type.
 2) Maintains multiple variable names using a single name.
 Arrays help to maintain large data under a single variable name.
 This avoid the confusion of using multiple variables.

10)what is anonomous array in java ? give example
   An array in Java without any name is known as an anonymous array.
 It is an array just for creating and using instantly. Using an anonymous .

11)write a program to print elements of array
    public class Array {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int [] arr = new int [] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
System.out.println("Elements of given array: ");
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
System.out.print(arr[i]);


12)   write a program to sort an array in java?
      public class SortArray  
{   
public static void main(String[] args)   
{    
int [] array = new int [] {90, 23, 5, 109, 12, 22, 67, 34};  
Arrays.sort(array);   
System.out.println("Elements of array sorted in ascending order: ");    
for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++)   
{       
System.out.println(array[i]);   
}   
}  
}  
  13)write a program to check whether the two given array are equal,given both contains same datatype and same length?
  
  
import java.util.Arrays;
  
public class CheckArraysEqual {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int a[] = { 30, 25, 40, 23 };
  
        int b[] = { 30, 26, 40, 78 };
        Arrays.equals(a, b);
        boolean result = Arrays.equals(a, b);
        if (result == true) {
            System.out.println("Two arrays are equal");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Two arrays are not equal");
        }
    }
}


14)write a program to throw ArrayOutOfBoundEXception?
     		public class Exception {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int ar[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        for (int i = 0; i <= ar.length; i++)
            System.out.println(ar[i]);
    }
}
      
  15) what will happen if you do not initialize an array?  
If you don't initialize the numbers in your array, they can be anything.
 Using this instead saves you having to loop over the array and assign every value to 0 . If you decide to insert other numbers, then initializing the array won't be needed.



 16)find the smallest and largest elements in an array?
     public class FindLargestSmallestNumberMain {
 
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 
 int arr[] = new int[]{12,56,76,89,100,343,21,234};
 
 int smallest = arr[0];
 int largest = arr[0];
 
 for(int i=1; i< arr.length; i++)
 {
 if(arr[i] > largest)
 largest = arr[i];
 else if (arr[i] < smallest)
 smallest = arr[i];
 
 }
 System.out.println("Smallest Number is : " + smallest);
 System.out.println("Largest Number is : " + largest); 
 }
}
 
17)what is static keywoprd,static variable,static method in java?
    the keyword static means that the particular member belongs to a type itself, rather than to an instance of that type. 
    the variable which is declared inside the class and outside the method with static keyword.
   the method which is declared inside the class and outside the method with static keyword.


18)can we Overload and Override static method in java?
   we can overload static method,but we cannot override static method. 

19)why main method is declared as static?
 JVM can load the class into the main memory. The main() method is the entry point of each and every Java program.
 The main() method is required because the compiler starts executing a program from this entry point.

20)what is static block?
    It is  special block, called a static block (also called static clause) that can be used for static initialization of a class. 
This code inside the static block is executed only once: the first time the class is loaded into memory.

21)can constructor be static in java?
   NO

22)can interface in java have a static methos in it?
NO

23)what is constructor chining?
   Constructor Chaining is the process of calling one constructor of a class from another constructor of the same class or another class using the current object of the class.   


24)what is constructor?
     constructor is a special method ,which takes the same name as class name and it does not have return type.

25)what happens if we keeps a return type to a constructor?
    If you keep a return of a constructor then that will be treated as a normal method and it will not execute while creating an object of the class.

26)can we call subclass constructor from super class constructor?
   No, we cannot call subclass constructor from superclass constructor

27)how can u create a instance of child class with parent class?
   By using the reference variable of the Parent class is capable to hold its object reference as well as its child object reference.

28)difference between  instance and class?
   A class is a blueprint which you use to create objects. An object is an instance of a class 

29)how many ways instance can be created?
 two ways

30)what happes if u create a instance of a class?
   "instantiating" a class.
